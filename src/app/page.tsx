            When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was
            originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for
            capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the
            first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be
            capitalized, as in <abbr>YTD</abbr> for year-to-date,{" "}
