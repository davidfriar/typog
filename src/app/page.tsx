            When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was
            originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for
            capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the
            first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be
            capitalized, as in <abbr>YTD</abbr> for year-to-date,{" "}

            A molecule may be homonuclear, that is, it consists of atoms of one
            chemical element, e.g. two atoms in the oxygen molecule (O
            <sub>2</sub>), or it may be heteronuclear, a chemical compound
            composed of more than one element, e.g. water (two hydrogen atoms
            and one oxygen atom: H<sub>2</sub>O).

            In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the relationship between mass
            and energy in a system&rsquo;s rest frame, where the two quantities
            differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of
            measurement. The principle is described by the physicist Albert
            Einstein&rsquo;s formula: E=mc<sup>2</sup>.
